<h1>About Calvin</h1>




<p>
    <big><p>Hi there, my name is Calvin.</p>

   I'm a beginner level Web Designer, and am currently the age of 24.
    My hobbies include traveling, photography,<br> and I love food. <strong>Casey Preston loves those things too.</strong>
    I hope that through this process I'll be able to develop a <br>career,<strong> work at Google,</strong>
        and have something that I find both challenging and interesting.</big>

   <BIG><p>I'm curious to see where this road takes me, <strong>no matter what I will learn some new skills</strong>
    and,<strike> hope</strike> something<br> productive <strong>will</strong> come out of it. I enjoy reading books when
       I have the time,<strong> Casey Preston does too.</strong>
    my favorite<br> author is Stephen King, and anything by him is something I enjoy,<strong> but his movies do him no
           favors.</strong></big>
</p>
