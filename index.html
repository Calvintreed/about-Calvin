<h1>About Calvin</h1>
<p> Hi there, my name is Calvin. I'm a beginner level Web Designer, and am currently the age of 24. My hobbies include travelling, photography, and I love food.
 I hope that through this process I'll be able to develop a career, and have something that I find both challenging and interesting. I'm curious to see where this road takes me, and hope that something productive comes out of it. I enjoy reading books when I have the time, my favorite author is Stephen King, and anything by him is something I enjoy.</p>
